## What is retargeting an ad?

You retarget or remarket an add by serving ads to people who have previously visited your website. Not all people who visit your site or read your email convert on the first visit. Retargeting works using email analytics and the SendGrid pixel to keep track of the people who visit your site and who view your emails and targeting ads to them as they're browsing Facebook and Instagram or as they're browsing sites online.

## Why does retargeting work?

A customers journey through purchasing your product is not always very straightforward. Sometimes they may come across you before they're ready to buy, or other times they may be looking at different options all at once. Retargeting brings your brand to the front in a timely way. Pixel-based targeting can immediately begin as soon as the customer leaves your site and list based targeting can target customers based on how they have been interacting with your emails. Otherwise, retargeting can expand your general brand awareness - so if someone isn't ready to buy yet, and they see retargeted ads between hitting your site and buying, by the time they are prepared to purchase, your brand comes to mind first.

## How does retargeting work?

There are two types of retargeting, and SendGrid offers both. First, there is list based retargeting. SendGrid can use data from your SendGrid contact list to target your customers with ads based on how they are interacting with your email campaigns. So you can double down on reengagement efforts with Ads, and you can use all of the segments you have set up with your email lists to target ads. There is also pixel based retargeting - where you put a JavaScript tag, called the SendGrid pixel, in the source code of your site to generate a list of customers visiting your site by using browser cookies. SendGrid uses this list to target these customers when they are on other sites. You can combine all of this functionality to have specific and on point ads that hit your customers at the right time.
