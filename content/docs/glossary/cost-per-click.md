Cost Per Click, or CPC, is a type of media purchasing model common within search and display advertising campaigns.

A pay-per-click advertising campaign is a digital marketing ad where every time your ad is clicked, taking a potential customer to your site, you pay the advertiser a fee. These ads appear most often as the sponsored ads at the top of Google search results - so pay-per-click ads are ads generated search results, and not considered organic search results.

Cost per click is determined by always being less than or equal to your max bid, you and your competitor's ad rank, and your Quality Score. Cost per click varies by industry and by your specific competitors. Determine whether or not the price you are paying per click has a compelling ROI to justify it - it's essential to find a balance between price and value. The best value clicks are both inexpensive and valuable. Of the factors that Google uses to calculate your cost is your Quality Score - accounts with a high Quality Score receives a discount and accounts with a low Quality Score receive an increase in cost per click price. You can improve your Quality Score by creating high quality and targeted ads that lead to high quality and targeted web pages. Also, make sure to select negative keywords in your Adwords account, and keep this up to date. Negative keywords filter out searchers who are unlikely to convert.
