## What is an ads channel?

Advertising channels are platforms companies use to promote their products. Traditional ads channels are print advertisements (like newspapers and direct mail postcards), television and radio. Marketers often combine these traditional channels with more modern channels, like websites, blogs, email, social media, and affiliate marketing on search engines and other web pages. 

## SendGrid ads channels

### Email marketing

Email marketing is an extremely effective digital marketing channel. When potential customers give you their email, they are interested in receiving newsletters, and emails targeted at conversion and product updates. Interested customers and potential customers are receiving timely and on point emails drive conversions. 

### Display Ads

Marketers can reach potential new and existing customers by placing display ads on third-party sites. Display ads are fantastic for driving general brand awareness and also for highly targeted segments. These can include banners, videos, overlays, boxes on the side or inline on the side of websites like blogs, lists, news sites, and any other high traffic website. At SendGrid, you can use your existing contact list, and segment data about how people are interacting with your emails to drive specific display advertisements. SendGrid charges for display ads based on Cost-Per-Impression (CPM).

### Social media marketing

Social media marketing (SMM) allows you to reach customers and potential customers through direct and person-to-person engagement. SendGrid offers SMM through Facebook and Instagram. You can use Facebook and Instagram to reach any consumer through targeting the pages, hashtags, and groups they follow.
