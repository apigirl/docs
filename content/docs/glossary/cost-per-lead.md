Cost per lead (CPL), or lead generation, is a digital advertising model where you pay per qualifying lead generated from each advertisement. This model is a performance-based model, but the responsibility for the success of the ad belongs to both ad publisher and the advertiser. The ad publishers need to make sure to place the ads with the right kind of audience to generate the leads, and then the people placing the ad are responsible for taking those leads and maximizing their funnel. 

There are two types of CPL - sales leads, and marketing leads. Sales leads target potential customers based on demographic information, and they tend to be industry-specific. The publisher may sell the same leads to multiple publishers or just a single advertiser. Marketing leads target ads based on a specific brand, and publishers sell them to a single advertiser, which makes the process extremely transparent.
